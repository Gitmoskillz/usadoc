(1) The delegation of authority to the Secretary&nbsp;<br>
20<br>
of the Treasury under section 382(m) of the Inter-<br>
21<br>
nal Revenue Code of 1986 does not authorize the&nbsp;<br>

(2) Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008–83 is&nbsp;<br>
2<br>
inconsistent with the congressional intent in enact-<br>

ing such section 382(m).&nbsp;<br>
4<br>
(3) The legal authority to prescribe Internal&nbsp;<br>

6<br>
(4) However, as taxpayers should generally be&nbsp;<br>
7<br>
able to rely on guidance issued by the Secretary of&nbsp;<br>
8<br>
the Treasury legislation is necessary to clarify the&nbsp;<br>
9<br>
force and effect of Internal Revenue Service Notice&nbsp;<br>
10<br>
2008–83 and restore the proper application under&nbsp;<br>
11<br>
